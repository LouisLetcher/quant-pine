# üìò Strategy Overview: Stocks - Lazy Trend Follower Strategy

## üîç What is This Strategy?

The **Stocks - Lazy Trend Follower Strategy** is designed to capture and capitalize on sustained trend movements in the stock market, specifically tailored for the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY). By utilizing a **Simple Moving Average (SMA)** or **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)** as a primary trend indicator, this strategy aims to enter long positions when the price is above the moving average and exit when it falls below, ensuring alignment with the prevailing market trend.

## üéØ Key Components:

### 1. Moving Average-Based Trend Filter

- **Moving Average Period (Default: 10):** Acts as the primary trend indicator. 
  - **SMA (Simple Moving Average):** Smooths out price data to identify the direction of the trend.
  - **EMA (Exponential Moving Average):** Gives more weight to recent prices, making it more responsive to price changes.

### 2. Confirmation Bars

- **Confirmation Period (Default: 1):** Ensures that the trend is sustained by requiring the price to remain above or below the moving average for a specified number of consecutive bars.
  - **Long Entry Confirmation:** Price must be above the moving average for the current and previous `confirmation` bars.
  - **Long Exit Confirmation:** Price must be below the moving average for the current and previous `confirmation` bars.

### 3. Trade Execution

- **Entry Signal:** 
  - **Long Position:** Enter a long position when the price is consistently above the moving average for the defined confirmation period.
  
- **Exit Signal:** 
  - **Close Long Position:** Exit the long position when the price consistently drops below the moving average for the defined confirmation period.

### 4. Visual Aids

- **Moving Average Plot:** Visual representation of the chosen moving average (SMA or EMA) for easy trend identification.
- **Background Highlighting (Optional):** 
  - **Green Background:** Marks potential long entry points.
  - **Red Background:** Indicates exit points to close long positions.
  
  *Note: Background highlighting lines are commented out in the script. Uncomment them to enable visual cues on the chart.*

## üí° Why Use This Strategy?

- **Trend Confirmation:** Utilizes moving average crossovers and consecutive confirmations to validate trend strength, reducing the likelihood of false signals.
- **Simplicity:** Straightforward logic that is easy to understand and implement, making it ideal for traders of all experience levels.
