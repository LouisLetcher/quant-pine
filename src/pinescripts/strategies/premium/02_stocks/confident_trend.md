# 📘 Strategy Overview: Stocks - Confident Trend Strategy

## 🔍 What is This Strategy?

The **Stocks - Confident Trend Strategy** is designed to identify and capitalize on significant trend movements within the stock market, specifically tailored for the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY). By leveraging a **Long-Term Simple Moving Average (SMA)** and analyzing extreme price movements, this strategy aims to enter trades when the market demonstrates strong upward momentum, ensuring alignment with the prevailing trend and mitigating risks associated with sudden reversals.

## 🎯 Key Components:

    - **Bearish Condition:** Comparative symbol's close < 200 SMA.

### 2. Extreme Price Movements

  - **Highest High:** Identifies the highest price reached in the last 365 bars (excluding the current bar).
  - **Lowest Low:** Identifies the lowest price reached in the last 365 bars (excluding the current bar).

### 3. Trade Execution

- **Entry Signals:**
