# Moving Average Crossover Strategy

The **Moving Average Crossover Strategy** is designed to identify trends in the market by analyzing the crossover of short-term and long-term exponential moving averages (EMAs). This strategy generates buy and sell signals when the short-term EMA crosses above or below the long-term EMA, combined with risk management using take profit and stop loss levels.
