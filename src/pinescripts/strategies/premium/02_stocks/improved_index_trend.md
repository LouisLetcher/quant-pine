# üìò Strategy Overview: Stocks - Improved Index Trend (SPY)

## üîç What is This Strategy?

The **Stocks - Improved Index Trend (SPY)** strategy is crafted to identify and leverage sustained trend movements in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY). By utilizing a combination of a **Fast Simple Moving Average (SMA)** and a **Slow Simple Moving Average (SMA)**, this strategy aims to enter and exit trades based on the crossover signals, ensuring alignment with the prevailing market trend.

## üéØ Key Components:

### Long-Term Trend Filter:

### Short-Term Trend Confirmation:

- **Fast SMA (57-Period):** Acts as a secondary trend indicator. Crossovers between the Fast SMA and Slow SMA signal potential trend changes.

### Trade Execution:

- **Entry Signal:** 
  - **Long Entry:** When the **Fast SMA (57)** crosses **above** the **Slow SMA (194)**, indicating the start of an upward trend.
  
- **Exit Signal:** 
  - **Close Long Position:** When the **Fast SMA (57)** crosses **below** the **Slow SMA (194)**, signaling a potential trend reversal.

### Visual Aids:

- **SMA Plots:** 
  - **Fast SMA (Blue):** Clearly distinguishes short-term trends.
  - **Slow SMA (Red):** Highlights the long-term trend direction.
