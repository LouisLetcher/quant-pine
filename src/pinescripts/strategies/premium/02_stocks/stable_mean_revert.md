# 📘 Strategy Overview: Stocks - Stable Mean Revert Strategy

## 🔍 What is This Strategy?

The **Stocks - Stable Mean Revert Strategy** is designed to identify and capitalize on mean reversion opportunities within the stock market, specifically tailored for the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY). By leveraging the **Relative Strength Index (RSI)** and a **Long-Term Simple Moving Average (SMA)** of a comparative symbol, this strategy aims to enter long positions when the market is oversold and aligned with a bullish trend, and exit positions based on momentum indicators.

## 🎯 Key Components:

### 1. Comparative Trend Analysis

- **Comparative Symbol (SPY by Default):**
  - **Long-Term SMA (200-Period):** Serves as the primary trend indicator for the comparative symbol.
    - **Bullish Condition:** Comparative symbol's close > 200 SMA.
    - **Bearish Condition:** Comparative symbol's close < 200 SMA.

### 2. RSI-Based Entry Signals

- **RSI Period (2):** Utilizes a very short RSI period to detect extreme market conditions quickly.
  - **Long Entry:** When RSI drops below **30**, indicating an oversold condition.

### 3. Trade Execution

- **Entry Signal:**
  - **Long Position:** Enter a long position when the **RSI (2)** is below **30** **and** the comparative symbol is in a bullish trend (close > 200 SMA).

- **Exit Signal:**
  - **Close Long Position:** Exit the long position when the current close is higher than the previous close, indicating upward momentum and the potential end of the mean reversion.

### 4. Visual Aids

- **Comparative SMA Plots:**
  - **Bullish SMA (Green):** Indicates the comparative symbol is in a bullish trend.
  - **Bearish SMA (Red):** *(Optional)* Indicates the comparative symbol is in a bearish trend.

- **RSI Plot:**
  - **RSI Line (Blue):** Visual representation of the RSI value.
  - **Oversold Threshold (Orange):** Marks the RSI level below which the market is considered oversold.
