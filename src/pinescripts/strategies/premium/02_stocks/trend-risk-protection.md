# üìò Strategy Overview: Stocks - Trend Risk Protection (SPY)

## üîç What is This Strategy?

The **Stocks - Trend Risk Protection (SPY)** strategy is designed to identify and capitalize on sustained trends in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY). By leveraging a long-term Simple Moving Average (SMA) and confirming consecutive price actions, this strategy aims to enter trades in the direction of the prevailing trend while protecting against significant reversals.

## üéØ Key Components:

### Long-Term Trend Filter:

- **200-Period SMA:** Acts as the primary trend indicator. Prices above the SMA suggest a bullish trend, while prices below indicate a bearish trend.

### Confirmation Bars:

- **Consecutive Price Confirmation:** Ensures that the trend is sustained by requiring the price to remain above or below the SMA for a specified number of consecutive bars (e.g., 4 additional bars).

### Trade Execution:

- **Entry Signal:** Enter a long position when the price is consistently above the SMA for the defined confirmation period.
- **Exit Signal:** Close the long position when the price consistently drops below the SMA for the defined confirmation period.

### Visual Aids:

- **SMA Plot:** Visual representation of the 200-period SMA.
- **Background Coloring:** Highlights potential entry (green) and exit (red) zones for easy identification.

## üí° Why Use This Strategy?
