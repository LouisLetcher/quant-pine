# üìò Strategy Overview: Stocks - Counter Punch Strategy

## üîç What is This Strategy?

The **Stocks - Counter Punch Strategy** is designed to identify and capitalize on extreme market conditions within the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY). By leveraging the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and multiple Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), this strategy aims to enter trades when the market is oversold or overbought and exit based on trend confirmations. This approach helps in mitigating risks associated with sudden market reversals.

## üéØ Key Components:

### 1. RSI-Based Entry Signals

- **RSI Period (2):** Utilizes a short RSI period to detect extreme market conditions quickly.
  - **Long Entry:** When RSI drops below **10**, indicating an oversold condition.
  - **Short Entry:** When RSI rises above **90**, indicating an overbought condition.

### 2. Moving Averages for Trend Confirmation

- **Short-Term SMA (9-Period):** Acts as a trend confirmation tool.
  - **Long Exit:** When the price crosses **above** the Short-Term SMA, signaling the end of the oversold condition.
  - **Short Exit:** When the price crosses **below** the Short-Term SMA, signaling the end of the overbought condition.

- **Long-Term SMA (200-Period):** Serves as the primary trend indicator.
  - **Long Entry Condition:** Ensures that the price is **above** the Long-Term SMA before entering a long position.
  - **Short Entry Condition:** Ensures that the price is **below** the Long-Term SMA before entering a short position.

### 3. Trade Execution

- **Entry Signals:**
  - **Long Position:** Enter when RSI < 10 **and** price > 200 SMA.
  - **Short Position:** Enter when RSI > 90 **and** price < 200 SMA.

  - **Long Exit:** Exit when price > 9 SMA.
  - **Short Exit:** Exit when price < 9 SMA.
