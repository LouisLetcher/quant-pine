# 📘 Strategy Overview: Crypto - Bitcoin Strategy

## 🔍 What is This Strategy?

The **Crypto - Bitcoin Strategy** is designed to identify and capitalize on bullish momentum within the Bitcoin market. By leveraging historical price comparisons and a Simple Moving Average (SMA), this strategy aims to enter long positions when the market demonstrates strong upward momentum and exit positions based on trend reversals. This approach helps in maximizing gains during bullish phases while minimizing exposure during downturns.

  - **Bearish Condition:** Current close < Close 50 bars ago.

### 2. Simple Moving Average (SMA)

- **50-period SMA:**
  - **Purpose:** Acts as a trend filter to confirm the strength of the current price movement.

  - **Bearish Confirmation:** Current close < 50-period SMA.

### 3. Trade Execution
